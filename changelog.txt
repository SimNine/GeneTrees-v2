This project is a branch of GeneTrees, forked after the 0.4.0 release.
The purpose of this branch is to simulate several trees simultaneously,
rather than individual trees on their own.
--------------------------------------------------------

0.1.0 - 6/11/17 (FORGOT TO COMPILE)
-Branched GeneTrees v1
-The simulation world can now be scaled to any width and any height
-The window can now be resized and panned around in
-Trees are generated and simulated concurrently
-For balance:
--changed structure nodes to consume 4x as much fitness as leaf or root nodes; may revert
--one sunlight and one nutrient are now converted into 4 fitness; may revert

0.2.0 - 9/16/17
-Added RainDrops and (partially) added GeneSeeds
-GeneSeeds are seeds that a parent tree drops when it has accumulated enough fitness
-GeneSeeds that touch the ground resemble their parent trees
-RainDrops are an alternative form of energy; they can be collected by new Raincatcher nodes
-Energy is collected by both Leaf and Raincatcher nodes
-RainDrops fall through every kind of node except RainCatchers
-A GeneTree now exchanges one energy point and one nutrient point for two fitness points
-Added a display to determine how many ticks occur in one second
-A "warmup" now occurs before any particle collisions with trees are calculated
--During "warmup", the environment is populated with particles

0.2.1 - 9/16/17
-Added multithreading functionality
-Multithreading can be toggled by pressing "m"
-Each tick, one thread computes collisions of SunSpecks with trees, 
	while another thread computes collisions of RainDrops with trees
	
0.3.0 - 9/29/17
-added another thread to compute fitness percentiles of trees
-changed color of info/debug text from white to black
-added display box for tracked tree in bottom-right corner
-the landscape is now a layered trig function (height is a function of displacement from x=0)

0.4.0 - 10/31/17
-Rebuilt the save system so that long-term runs can be carried out
